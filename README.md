## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Hexagonal Architecture (Clean Architecture)
All services follow **hexagonal architecture** patterns with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and models
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and service orchestration  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies (databases, APIs, messaging)
- **Ports & Adapters**: Interface-driven design for easy testing and flexibility

### Event-Driven Design
- **Kafka Integration**: Asynchronous event processing for scalability
- **Event Sourcing**: State changes broadcast as events
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via events and gRPC

### Comprehensive Observability
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Request counts, latency, error rates, business metrics
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs via Loki
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow tracking across services
- **Health Checks**: Service availability and dependency monitoring

## 🔧 Architecture Decisions

### Why Hexagonal Architecture?
- **Testability**: Easy unit testing with mocked dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Swap implementations without changing business logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Independent service evolution

### Why Event-Driven Design?
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct knowledge of each other
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing handles load spikes
- **Reliability**: Event replay and processing guarantees
- **Extensibility**: New services can subscribe to existing events

### Why gRPC?
- **Performance**: Binary protocol with HTTP/2 multiplexing
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed contracts with Protobuf
- **Language Agnostic**: Easy polyglot service development
- **Streaming**: Bidirectional streaming for real-time features
